# Changelog for theHarmonicAlgorithm

## Version 1.0.0.0 is complete!

The Harmonic Algorithm 1.0.0.0 implements a generation, filtering and 
exploration algorithm for triadic musical data, with a focus on composing
with the overtones of an instrument and scope for use in traditional 
composition, instrumental study or even live performance.

This functionality is augmented by a conceptually complete Markov Chain 
Machine Learning implementation, trained on Bach Chorale harmonisation data 
retrieved from the UCI Machine Learning Repository (Dua, D., Karra Taniskidou, 
E., 2017 http://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml). 

In version 1.0.0.0 of The Harmonic Algorithm, a command line interface is
provided for interaction with the underlying musical and numerical algorithms.
